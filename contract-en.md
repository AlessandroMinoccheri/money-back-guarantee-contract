# Money Back Guarantee Contract

This contract adopts an iterative formula for the implementation of features and execution of activities identified and defined during our previous meetings.  

After your acceptance of this contract, we will start the production activities that are going to take place as following:
1. A meeting is scheduled in order prioritize all the planned features.
2. The working process will be divided in iterations of 1 week each; in each iteration (and so every week), there will be a meeting with the customer (face to face or with a conference call) during which implemented artifacts will be shown.
3. After each iteration, the customer has the chance to accept the delivered artifact and go on to the following iteration or refuse the delivered artifact.
    * in case of acceptance: we go on through next iteration, choosing with the customer  the features to develop.
    * in case of refusal, no cost will be charged on the customer and the project will continue by repeating the iteration

By the end of each iteration (every week) the customer:

* Will have a working and usable version of the software in his hands in case of acceptance.
* Will have the chance to change the priority of the features that are going to be implemented in the  following iteration/s.
* Can decide to add/remove features from the backlog. A decrease in number of features will be matched by a decrease in number of needed iterations (and of course of the price). As features backlog grows up, so will the number of needed iterations (and so the price).
* Can decide to stop the project, with no development of the previously planned features, considered not necessary anymore; in this case only delivered iterations will be charged on the customer.
